# users and roles
Users and Roles - RotaCloud

Using React and Redux with 2 data files to show a table of users and roles. The users and roles are stored in the state and passed down from the App.js as props. They are then accessed by the User List which matches the role with the id and shows the names. A function orders the list.

To improve - differentiate betweeen containers (App) and components within the file tree. Add testing using mocha, chai, jest.
